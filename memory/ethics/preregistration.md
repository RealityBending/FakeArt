Study Description:

This follow-up study investigates 1) the effect of individuals’ prior aesthetic appraisals (beauty, emotional valence, meaningfulness, worth) on the subsequent recognition and memory of artworks and their associated prior subjective reality beliefs (Human vs AI-Generated and Original vs Copy/Forgery); 2) the impact of attitudes towards AI on participants’ recognition accuracy of artworks according to a reality beliefs modulation (Original/AI-Generated/Human Forgery)...... [ADD MORE?]. Participants are shown 96 [DOUBLE CHECK] artworks (all human-made originals, extracted from the VAPS dataset), including images seen in the previous study as well as novel images. Each artwork is presented separately, where participants are asked whether they recognise the stimulus from the previous study. If “Yes”, participants are asked which label the image was assigned in the previous study as a reality beliefs modulation (Original/AI-Generated/Human Forgery) and are asked to remember their subjective reality beliefs about the stimulus on two scales (Human vs AI-Generated and Original vs Copy/Forgery). If “No”, participants are asked no further questions about that artwork. All code, content, timeline, and evolution of the experiment are publicly available at https://github.com/RealityBending/FakeArt



(Potential) Hypotheses:

1. Artworks that received extreme aesthetic ratings (beauty, emotional valence, meaningfulness, worth), either positive or negative, in the initial study will exhibit higher recognition accuracy in the follow-up study relative to artworks that received more neutral aesthetic ratings. 	    = main hypothesis?

	There will be a positive linear relationship between participants' aesthetic judgement and recognition accuracy, such that higher aesthetic evaluations predict a greater likelihood of stimuli recognition accuracy.

2. Participants who reported holding stronger attitudes towards AI, either positive or negative, in the initial study will exhibit higher recognition accuracy (source memory and memory of the reality beliefs modulation and subjective reality beliefs) in the follow-up study towards artworks initially labelled "AI-Generated" relative to those artworks initially labelled "Original" and "Human Forgery".

3. On average, if participants rated “Original” (and “Human Forgery”???) artworks as being more emotive (positive/negative) than "AI-Generated" artworks in the initial study, it may be that "Original" (and "Human Forgery"???) artworks generally exhibit greater recognition accuracy than “AI-Generated” artworks in the follow-up study.

4. Perhaps something about the complexity of artworks (measured through eye-tracking data in initial study)???
